# Changelog

All notable changes to this repo are recorded here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions follow semver at the **repo** level — individual plugin versions are tracked in their `plugin.json`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`uninstall.ps1`** — native Windows uninstaller (PowerShell). Mirrors `uninstall.sh`: removes managed symlinks/copies and strips hook entries from `settings.json` if Python is available.
- **`.gitignore`** — added `settings.local.json`, `settings-local.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json` to prevent accidental commit of Claude Code machine-specific overrides.

### Changed
- **`install.sh --no-hooks` / `--no-plugin` now actively remove** previously-installed components rather than silently leaving them in place. Running `install.sh --no-hooks` after a full install removes the hook symlinks and strips the hook entries from `settings.json`. This matches what users expect from the flag name.
- **`uninstall.sh` and `uninstall.ps1` symlink matching tightened** — require a path-segment boundary (`/claude-config/` rather than a loose substring) so unrelated paths like `claude-config-backup` can't be matched.
- **README** — surfaces the Windows installation path from the main "Install" section (previously only reachable by scrolling to the Windows section); adds the native Windows uninstall command to the Uninstall section; documents update workflow for Windows.

### Fixed
- **`install.ps1` / `uninstall.ps1`** — removed PowerShell 7+ only operators (`||`, `??`) that broke on Windows PowerShell 5.1 (the default on Windows 10/11). Replaced with PS5.1-compatible forms.
- **`install.ps1` / `uninstall.ps1`** — replaced em-dashes and box-drawing characters with ASCII. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads script files without a BOM using the ANSI code page, which mangled UTF-8 multi-byte sequences and caused parser errors at every line with fancy characters.
- **`uninstall.ps1`** — probe Python with a real `--version` call before using it, so the Windows Store `python3.exe` stub (a placeholder that errors at runtime) is correctly identified as "not Python" and the script prints a helpful skip-message instead of a red error.

### Verified
- End-to-end install and uninstall on Windows with both Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.6.1. PS 5.1 falls back to file copies (no Dev Mode / admin); PS 7.6.1 successfully creates symlinks. Round-trip install → uninstall → install works cleanly on both.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`uninstall.sh`** — idempotent reverse of `install.sh`; removes managed symlinks and strips our hook entries from `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **`install.sh --no-hooks` / `--no-plugin` / `--help`** flags for granular installs.
- **`install.ps1`** — native Windows installer (PowerShell). Creates symlinks with auto-fallback to file copy when Developer Mode / admin isn't available. Skips hooks (bash-only).
- **`references/fix-vuln/`** and **`references/upgrade/`** — reference docs for `/vuln` and `/upgrade` are now vendored into the repo (previously external at `~/.copilot/skills/`).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — this file.

### Changed
- **Hook field names corrected**: `preload-context.sh` now reads the `prompt` field (with `user_prompt`/`message` fallbacks) from the UserPromptSubmit payload; `test-notify.sh` now reads `tool_input.command` and `tool_response.output` (with top-level fallbacks) from the PostToolUse payload. Both hooks were previously silently exiting early due to reading the wrong fields.
- **`preload-context.sh` hardening** — removed `set -euo pipefail`, added `python3` availability guard, error-tolerant command substitution. Matches the robustness of `test-notify.sh`.
- **`/impl` step 8 agents** now receive a structured change summary block (including `git diff --stat` output and notable additions/removals) instead of a one-sentence description. Documentation, knowledge, and instructions agents can now reason precisely about what changed.
- **`install.sh` location guard** — refuses to run unless located at `$HOME/.claude/claude-config/`. Prevents silent misconfiguration when the repo is cloned elsewhere.
- **`install.sh` plugin symlink** — now unconditionally `rm -rf`s the target before `ln -sf`, preventing the "stray nested symlink" bug that occurred on repeated runs.
- **`install.sh` settings.json guard** — creates an empty `{}` skeleton if `~/.claude/settings.json` doesn't exist, rather than crashing.
- **`test-notify.sh` output parsing** — uses `python3` for framework output parsing (portable) instead of `grep -oP` (GNU-only, fails on macOS).
- **`/vuln` intro** — clarified the sequential-then-parallel execution model.
- **`/upgrade` Phase 2 step 3** — excludes `.github/workflows/` to prevent GitHub Actions from being processed twice.
- **README** — added detailed per-command phase explanations, Windows section, uninstall instructions, install-flag table.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-24

Initial shareable repo.

### Added
- **`commands/impl.md`** — `/impl` command with Explore subagent before planning and three parallel post-implementation agents (Documentation / Knowledge / Instructions).
- **`commands/vuln.md`** — `/vuln` command with parallel NVD / Detect / Baseline research before fix.
- **`commands/upgrade.md`** — `/upgrade` command with parallel compatibility research and GitHub Actions agents in Phase 1; uses `workflow-tools:test-baseline` for the test baseline.
- **`plugins/workflow-tools/`** — plugin with the reusable `test-baseline` agent (Maven / Gradle / npm / pytest / Makefile detection).
- **`hooks/notify-done.sh`** — Stop hook; cross-platform desktop notification (macOS / Linux / WSL2 fallback chain).
- **`hooks/preload-context.sh`** — UserPromptSubmit hook; injects git branch/status/log for `/impl` / `/vuln` / `/upgrade`.
- **`hooks/test-notify.sh`** — PostToolUse:Bash hook; parses test output and notifies.
- **`install.sh`** — idempotent installer; `ln -sf` symlinks + Python JSON merge.
- **`settings-additions.json`** — hook entries merged into `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **`README.md`** — setup, usage, and platform notes.
- **`docs/specs/2026-04-24-command-subagents-hooks-design.md`** — design document.
